# I gave the player health which could be lost to the fire or added by drinking from the chalice. I added several places where some text wouldn't be listed if a player had already visited a certain knot. For example, if you visited the knot "Roll" before "On_fire" the text meant for those just leaving the cave wouldn't appear. I also allowed the player to pick up a torch and a sword. With the sword, you had the option to kill a snake and with the torch, you could light different passages. Finally, I ended up with around 20 different knots in total.
