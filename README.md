# I gave the player health which could be lost to the fire or added by drinking from the chalice. For my reflected choice I added an option for the player's sister's name which would be reflected later if you chose Maggie, in which case it mentions she is scared of snakes. When the player catches on fire I added a loop where it tells you what part of your body is on fire. I added several places where some text wouldn't be listed if a player had already visited a certain knot. For example, if you visited the knot "Roll" before "On_fire" the text meant for those just leaving the cave wouldn't appear. I also allowed the player to pick up a torch and a sword. With the sword, you had the option to kill a snake and with the torch, you could light different passages. Finally, I ended up with around 20 different knots in total.
